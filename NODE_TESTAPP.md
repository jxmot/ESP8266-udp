# NodeJS UDP-Test Server

This document will describe some JavaScript files that are run on Node. So at this point I'll assume that you're familiar with Node and can run a script.

## Requirements

* A *local* Node installation. This can be on your PC (*Linux, Mac or Windows*), or on any other node-available computer on your network.
* The JavaScript files in this repository at `/nodejs`, place copies where your Node installation is available.

## Running the test

Just as usual - 

`>node server-udp.js`

That's it! No additional packages are needed.

## Sample Output
